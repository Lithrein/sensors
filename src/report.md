# A sensor field simulation framework

## Aim

The aim of this framework is to be able to simulate a field of sensors
on a given set of machines. We should set be able to see whether the
number of machines allocated is enough for a real-time analysis.

## Expressivity of the language

The language should be designed such that a researcher can describe the
behavior of a pool of sensors. We assume that the main tools to describe
the behavior

### The language to model mathematical models

### The language to model captors and computers

### The language to model simulations

## Motivations behind the simulation

The objective is to test whether a middleware is robust enough to process
the data produced by a large pool of sensors. Thus, a core problem is the
interaction of the captor simulation and the middleware.

Traceability of captors and how to divide captors by machines

Captors geometry: flat, grid, ring, as a graph (with rules)

Kind of law: polynomial, cellular automaton,
